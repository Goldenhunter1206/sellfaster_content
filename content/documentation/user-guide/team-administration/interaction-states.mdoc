Define and manage the states that addresses can be in. States help your team track the progress of interactions with each address.

## Accessing Interaction States

1. Ensure you're in your team account
2. Click **States** in the sidebar
3. The URL is `/home/[team]/states`

## What are States?

States represent the current status of an address in your sales process. They help your team:

- Track progress of each address
- Filter addresses by status
- Color-code map markers
- Coordinate follow-up activities

### Default States

When a new team is created, three default states are automatically added:

| State                     | Keep Open | Follow Up | Color |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ----- |
| **No Interest**           | No        | No        | Gray  |
| **No Answer**             | Yes       | No        | Amber |
| **Appointment Requested** | Yes       | Yes       | Green |

## Viewing States

### States Table

The states table displays:

| Column          | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**        | State name with colored indicator. Shows "Default" badge if default, "Archived" if archived |
| **Description** | State description (optional)                                                                |
| **Keep Open**   | Badge showing Yes/No                                                                        |
| **Follow Up**   | Badge showing Yes/No                                                                        |
| **Projects**    | Projects using this state (shows first 2 with count of additional)                          |

### Filtering States

By default, archived states are hidden. Toggle **Show archived** to view them.

## Creating States

### Add New State

1. Click **Create State**
2. Fill in the form:
  - **Name** (required) - Short, clear name
  - **Description** (optional) - What this state means
  - **Keep Open** - Address remains open for future interactions
  - **Follow Up** - Requires scheduling a follow-up date (only available if Keep Open is enabled)
  - **Color** - Select from preset colors or enter a custom hex code
  - **Default** - Automatically assign this state to new projects
3. Click **Save**

> **Note:** Creating states requires the `interactionsstate:create` permission.

### State Fields

| Field           | Required | Description                                                           |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**        | Yes      | State identifier (max 255 characters)                                 |
| **Description** | No       | Explanation of the state                                              |
| **Color**       | No       | Hex color code (e.g., #3B82F6). Auto-determined if not set            |
| **Keep Open**   | No       | Default: Yes. If enabled, address stays active                        |
| **Follow Up**   | No       | Default: No. If enabled, requires follow-up date (requires Keep Open) |
| **Default**     | No       | If enabled, automatically assigned to new projects                    |

### State Behavior

**Keep Open:**

- When enabled: Address remains in the active pipeline
- When disabled: Address is considered closed/completed

**Follow Up:**

- Can only be enabled if Keep Open is also enabled
- When enabled: System prompts for a follow-up date when this state is selected
- Useful for states like "Callback Requested" or "Meeting Scheduled"

### Color Selection

Colors help visually identify states on:

- Map markers
- Table badges
- Charts and reports

A predefined color palette is available, or you can enter a custom hex color. If no color is selected, one is automatically determined based on the Keep Open and Follow Up settings.

## Editing States

### Modify State

1. Click the actions menu (three dots) on the state row
2. Select **Edit**
3. Update the fields
4. Save changes

> **Note:** Editing states requires the `interactionsstate:update` permission.

## Project Assignments

States are assigned to projects to make them available when recording interactions.

### Assign to Projects

1. Click the actions menu on a state
2. Select **Assign to Projects**
3. Toggle projects on/off to assign/unassign
4. Changes save automatically

The dialog shows:

- All active and draft projects
- Project status badge
- Current assignment status

> **Note:** Archived states cannot be assigned to projects.

## Archiving States

### Archive a State

Instead of permanently deleting states, you can archive them to preserve historical data:

1. Click the actions menu on the state
2. Select **Archive**
3. Review the warning (shows how many projects use this state)
4. Confirm

When archived:

- State is removed from all project assignments
- Existing interactions using this state are preserved
- State no longer appears in dropdowns
- State can be restored later

> **Note:** Archiving states requires the `interactionsstate:delete` permission.

### Restore a State

1. Enable **Show archived** to view archived states
2. Click the actions menu on the archived state
3. Select **Unarchive**
4. State becomes active again

After restoring, you'll need to reassign the state to projects.

## Audit History

Team owners can view the change history for any state:

1. Click the actions menu on a state
2. Select **View Audit History**
3. See all changes made to the state and its project assignments

## Permissions

| Action                 | Permission Required        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| View states            | `interactionsstate:select` |
| Create states          | `interactionsstate:create` |
| Edit states            | `interactionsstate:update` |
| Archive/Restore states | `interactionsstate:delete` |
| Assign to projects     | `interactionsstate:create` |
| View audit history     | Team owner only            |

## Best Practices

### Designing States

1. **Keep it simple** - Start with a few essential states
2. **Clear names** - Use names that are easy to understand
3. **Distinct colors** - Use different colors for easy visual identification

## Accessing Member Management

1. Ensure you're in your team account
2. Click **Members** in the sidebar
3. The URL is `/home/[team]/members`

## Team Members List

### Viewing Members

The members table displays:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Member's display name (shows "You" badge for your own entry) |
| **Email** | Account email |
| **Role** | Role badge (owner, member, or custom role) |
| **Joined** | Date they joined the team |
| **Actions** | Dropdown menu with available actions |

### Role Badges

## Inviting New Members

### Sending Invitations

1. Click **Invite Members** button
2. Enter email address
3. Select role for invitee
4. Click **Send Invitation**

You can invite up to 5 members at once:

3. Click **Send Invitations**

> **Note:** Inviting members requires the `invites.manage` permission.

### Role Selection

When inviting, you can only assign roles at or below your own hierarchy level. This prevents members from granting permissions they don't have themselves.

### Invitation Email

Invitees receive an email with:
- Team name
- Accept invitation link
- The link to create an account or sign in

## Pending Invitations

| **Role** | Role that will be granted |
| **Invited At** | When the invitation was sent |
| **Expires At** | When the invitation expires |
| **Status** | Active (green) or Expired (warning) |
| **Actions** | Available actions |

### Managing Invitations

Actions available for pending invitations:

| Action | Description | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Update Invitation** | Change the assigned role | `roles.manage` permission |
| **Renew Invitation** | Resend an expired invitation | `roles.manage` permission, invitation must be expired |
| **Remove Invitation** | Cancel the invitation | `roles.manage` permission |

## Member Roles

### Role Hierarchy

Roles have a hierarchy level that determines permissions. Higher hierarchy levels grant more access.

### Changing Roles

4. Choose the new role
5. Confirm

**Restrictions:**

- You can only assign roles at or below your hierarchy level
- Primary owners can change any role

## Transferring Ownership

Primary owners can transfer team ownership:

1. Find the member to receive ownership
2. Click the actions menu
3. Select **Transfer Ownership**
4. Read the warning disclaimer
5. Complete OTP verification

> **Warning:** After transfer, you lose owner privileges and the new owner gains full control of the team.

Save filter and search configurations on your dashboard for one-click access. Quickly switch between different views of your addresses without re-applying filters each time.

## What is a Saved View?

A saved view is a snapshot of your current dashboard configuration — including filters, search terms, sorting, and column settings. Instead of manually re-applying the same filters every time, save them as a named view and load them with a single click.

## What Gets Saved

A saved view captures the following dashboard settings:

{% table %}

- **City Filter**

---
- **Latest State Filter**
- Filter by the latest interaction state
---
- **Sort Preference**
- Sort by address or distance
---
- **Search Text**
- Your current search query
---
- **Search Mode**
- Simple, structured, or AI search mode
---
- **Structured Query Filters**

---
- **Custom Field Filters**
- Any applied custom field filters
---
- **Column Visibility**

---
- **Page Size**

{% /table %}
